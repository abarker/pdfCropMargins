Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 3.04 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* New text extractor.
* Added the pdftohtml tool.
* Added the pdftopng tool.
* New trapezoid-based rasterizer core (for performance).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

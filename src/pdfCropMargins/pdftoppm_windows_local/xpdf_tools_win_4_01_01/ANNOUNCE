Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.01 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

*** The Xpdf web site has moved to www.xpdfreader.com ***

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

4.01 is primarily a bug fix release.  There are some new features:
* Added remote server mode back into xpdf.
* Added support for Unicode file names for the command line tools on
  Windows.
* Added the tabStateFile setting, the saveTabState/loadTabState
  commands, and the "-tabstate" switch to xpdf.  [Thanks to Christian
  Barthel for the suggestion.]
* Added the defaultPrinter xpdfrc setting.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page:

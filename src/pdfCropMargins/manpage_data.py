pdfCropMargins -- a program to crop the margins of PDF files

This module sets up an argparse command-line parser, named `cmd_parser`, meant for
use with the prettifying routines in `prettified_argparse.py`.  The command-line
arguments, flags, and their descriptions are all defined here.  The formatting
used here assumes that the prettified formatting directives from
`prettified_argparse.py` are being used.

The usage is::

   from prettified_argparse import parse_command_line_arguments
   from manpage_data import cmd_parser

Somewhere in the program, the function should be called as::

    args = parse_command_line_arguments(cmd_parser)

Note that the default text formatting in the description is raw, i.e., it is
unformatted unless the formatting directive ^^f is specified.  So literal
'%' characters can be used.  The option descriptions are not raw, however,
and so '%' characters must be escaped as '%%'.

General argparse reminders and warnings:
  1) Using `nargs=1` puts the single value inside a list, default doesn't.
  2) First argument specified is the one which appears in the Usage message.
  3) The metavar kwarg sets the string for option's VALUES in Usage messages.
  4) With default values you can always assume some value is assigned.
  5) Use `numargs=1` and `default=[]` to test whether or not, say, an int-valued
     option was selected at all (or you could check for value None).

Description:

^^f
   A command-line application to crop the margins of PDF files.  Cropping the
   margins can make it easier to read the pages of a PDF document -- whether
   the document is printed or displayed on a screen -- because the display
   fonts are larger.  Margin-cropping is also sometimes useful when a PDF file
   is included in a document as a graphic.

   By default 10% of the existing margins will be retained; the rest will be
   eliminated.  There are many options which can be set, however, including the
   percentage of existing margins to retain.

   Here is a simple example of cropping a file named document.pdf and writing
   the cropped output-document to a file named croppedDocument.pdf:

   \a\a\apdf-crop-margins document.pdf -o croppedDocument.pdf

   The alias 'pdfcropmargins' can also be used to launch the program in place
   of 'pdf-crop-margins'.  If no destination is provided a filename will be
   automatically generated from the name of the source file (see below).

   The pdfCropMargins program works by changing the page sizes which are stored
   in the PDF file (and are interpreted by programs like Acrobat Reader).
   Both the CropBox and the MediaBox are set to the newly-computed cropped
   size.  After this the view of the document in most programs will be the new,
   cropped view.

   In order to reduce the number of copies of a document which must be saved, a
   basic '--restore' option is provided.  When cropping a file not produced by
   the pdfCropMargins program the default is to save the intersection of the
   MediaBox and any existing CropBox in the ArtBox.  This saves the "usual"
   view of the original document in programs like Acrobat Reader.  Subsequent
   crops of a file produced by pdfCropMargins do not by default alter the
   ArtBox.  The restore option simply copies the saved values back to the
   MarginBox and CropBox.  Note that this assumes the ArtBox is unused (it is
   rarely used, and this feature can be turned off with the -A option).  So,
   for example, you can make annotations to a file with cropped margins and
   still produce a version with the annotations which viewers display as the
   original margins.  Programs which change the "Producer" string in the PDF
   may interfere with this feature.

   Below are several examples using more of the command-line options, each
   applied to an input file called doc.pdf.  The output filename is unspecified
   in most of these examples, so the program will automatically generate the
   filename (or an output filename can always be explicitly provided with '-o'):
^^f

     1) Crop doc.pdf so that all the pages are set to the same size and the
     cropping amount is uniform across all the pages (this gives a nice two-up
     appearance).  The default of retaining 10% of the existing margins is
     used.  Note carefully that '-u' only makes the amount to be cropped uniform
     for each page; if the pages do not have the same size to begin with they
     will not have the same size afterward unless the '-s' option is also used.

        pdf-crop-margins -u -s doc.pdf

     2) Crop each page of doc.pdf individually (i.e., not uniformly), keeping 50%
     of the existing margins.

        pdf-crop-margins -p 50 doc.pdf

     3) Crop doc.pdf uniformly, keeping 50% of the left margin, 20% of the bottom
     margin, 40% of the right margin, and 10% of the top margin.

        pdf-crop-margins -u -p4 50 20 40 10 doc.pdf

     4) Crop doc.pdf retaining 20% of the margins, and then reduce the right page
     margins only by an absolute 12 points.

        pdf-crop-margins -p 20 -a4 0 0 12 0 doc.pdf

     5) Add a constant 5bp around the bare bounding boxes on all pages (note the
     negative value passed to the `-a` option, which adds space rather than
     removing it).

        pdf-crop-margins -p 0 -a -5 doc.pdf

     6) Pre-crop the document by 5bp on each side before computing the bounding
     boxes.  Then crop retaining 50% of the computed margins.  This can be
     useful for difficult documents such as scanned books with page-edge noise
     or other "features" inside the current margins.

        pdf-crop-margins -ap 5 -p 50 doc.pdf

     7) Crop doc.pdf, re-naming the cropped output file to doc.pdf and backing
     up the original file in a file named backup_doc.pdf.

        pdf-crop-margins -mo -pf -su "backup" doc.pdf

     8) Crop the margins of doc.pdf to 120% of their original size, increasing
     the margins.  Use Ghostscript to find the bounding boxes without explicit
     rendering by pdfCropMargins.

        pdf-crop-margins -p 120 -c gb doc.pdf

     9) Crop the margins of doc.pdf ignoring the 10 largest margins on each edge
     (over the whole document).  This is especially good for noisy documents
     where all the pages have very similar margins, or when you want to ignore
     marginal annotations which only occur on a few pages.

        pdf-crop-margins -m 10 doc.pdf

     10) Crop doc.pdf, launch the acroread viewer on the cropped output, and then
     query as to whether or not to rename the cropped file doc.pdf and back up
     the original file as doc_uncropped.pdf.

        pdf-crop-margins -mo -q doc.pdf

     11) Crop pages 1-100 of doc.pdf, cropping all even pages uniformly and all odd
     pages uniformly.

        pdf-crop-margins -g 1-100 -e doc.pdf

     12) Try to restore doc.pdf to its original margins, assuming it was cropped
     with pdfCropMargins previously.  Note that the default output filename is
     still named doc_cropped.pdf, even though it is the recovered file.  Use the
     '-mo' option to modify doc.pdf and backup the previous version.

        pdf-crop-margins -r doc.pdf

^^f
   There are many different ways to use this program.  After finding a method
   which works well for a particular task or workflow pattern it is often
   convenient to make a simple shell script (batch file) which invokes the
   program with those particular options and settings.  Simple template scripts
   for Bash and Windows are packaged with the program, in the bin directory.
   The program can also be called from a user's Python program (when discoverable
   in the Python path) by using code such as
^^f

        from pdfCropMargins import crop
        crop(["-p", "20", "-u", "-s", "paper.pdf"])

^^f
   When printing a document with closely-cropped pages it may be necessary to
   use options such as "Fit to Printable Area".  It may also be necessary to
   fine-tune the size of the retained margins if the edges of the text are
   being cut off.

   Sometimes a PDF file is corrupted or non-standard to the point where the
   routines used by this program raise an error and exit.  In that case it can
   sometimes help to repair the PDF file before attempting to crop it.  If it
   is readable by Ghostscript then the following command will often repair
   it sufficiently:
^^f

        gs -o repaired.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress corrupted.pdf

^^f
   This command can also be used to convert some PostScript (.ps) files to PDF.
   The option '--gsFix' (or '-gsf') will automatically attempt to apply this
   fix, provided Ghostscript is available.  See the description of that option
   for more information.

   The pdfCropMargins program handles rotated pages (such as pages in landscape
   mode versus portrait mode) as follows.  All rotated pages are un-rotated as
   soon as they are read in.  All the cropping is then calculated.  Finally, as
   the crops are applied to the pages, the rotation is re-applied.  This may
   give unexpected results in documents which mix pages at different rotations,
   especially with the '--uniform' or '--samePageSize' options.  For rotated
   pages the arguments of all the options which take four arguments, one for
   each margin, are shifted so the left, bottom, right, and top margins
   correspond to the screen appearance (regardless of any internal rotation).

   All the command-line options to pdfCropMargins are described below.  The
   following definition is useful in precisely defining what several of the
   options do.  The "delta values" are the absolute reduction lengths, in
   points, which are applied to each original page to get the final cropped
   page.  There is a delta value for each margin, on each page.  In the usual
   case where all the margin sizes decrease, all the deltas are positive.  A
   delta value can, however, be negative (e.g., when percentRetain > 100 or
   when a negative absolute offset is used).  When a delta value is negative
   the corresponding margin size will increase.

   Crop all the pages uniformly.  This forces the magnitude of margin-cropping

   applied after all the delta values have been calculated for each page,
   individually.  Then all the left-margin delta values, for each page, are set
   to the smallest left-margin delta value over every page.  The bottom, right,
   and top margins are processed similarly.  Note that this effectively adds
   some margin space (relative to the margins obtained by cropping pages
   individually) to some of the pages.  If the pages of the original document

   value over all the pages is no longer chosen.  Instead, for each margin the
   nth smallest delta value (with n numbered starting at zero) is chosen over
   all the pages.  The argument is the integer n, for example '-m 4'.  Choosing
   n to be half the number of pages gives the median delta value.  This option
   is useful for cropping noisy scanned PDFs which have a common margin size on
   most of the pages, or for ignoring annotations which only appear in the
   margins of a few pages.  This option essentially causes the program to
   ignores the n largest tight-crop margins when computing common delta values
   over all the pages.  Increasing n always either increases the cropping
   amount or leaves it unchanged.  Some trial-and-error may be needed to choose
   the best number.  Using '-m 1' tends to work well with arXiv papers (which

   all the pages.  This operation is always done before any others (except
   '--absolutePreCrop').  The cropping is then done as usual, but note that any
   margin percentages (such as for '--percentRetain') are now relative to this
   new, possibly larger, page size.  The resulting pages are still cropped
   independently by default, and will not necessarily all have the same size

   direct Ghostscript bounding-box calculation ('gb').  For pdftoppm or

   This option is maintained for backward compatibility; using '-c gb' is now
   preferred.  Use Ghostscript to directly find the bounding boxes for the
   pages, with no explict rendering of the pages.  (The default is to
   explicitly render the PDF pages to image files and calculate bounding boxes
   from the images.) This method tends to be much faster, but it does not work
   with scanned PDF documents.  It also does not allow for choosing the

   This is a simple undo operation which essentially undoes all the crops ever

   intersected with the CropBox as the new ArtBox (since the ArtBox is rarely
   used).  The Producer metadata is checked to see if this was the first time.
   If so, the ArtBox for each page is simply copied to the MediaBox and the
   CropBox for the page.  This restores the earlier view of the document, such
   as in Acrobat Reader (but does not completely restore the previous condition
   in cases where the MediaBox and CropBox differed or the ArtBox had a
   previous value).  Any options such as '-u', '-p', and '-a' which do not make
   sense in a restore operation are ignored.  Note that as far as default

   Attempt to repair the input PDF file with Ghostscript before it is read-in.

   name-generation, the '--modify-original' option, and so forth.  This option
   is often helpful if the program hangs or raises an error due to a corrupted
   PDF file.  Note that when re-cropping a file already cropped by
   pdfCropMargins this option is probably not necessary, and if it is used in a
   re-crop (at least with current versions of Ghostscript) it will reset the
   Producer metadata which the pdfCropMargins program uses to tell if the file
   was already cropped by the program (so the '--restore' option will not work

   This option moves (renames) the original document file to a backup filename
   and then moves the cropped file to the original document's filename (and
   directory path).  Thus it effectively crops the original document file
   in-place and makes a backup copy of the original file in the output
   directory.  The backup filename for the original document is always
   generated from the original filename; any prefix or suffix which would be
   added by the program to generate a filename (by default a "_cropped" suffix)
   is modified accordingly (by default to "_uncropped").  The '--usePrefix',
   '--stringUncropped', and '--stringSeparator' options can all be used to
   customize the generated backup filename.  If an output path is specified via
   the '--outfile' ('-o') option then the backup document is written to that
   directory (the same directory the cropped file was first written to).  This
   operation is performed last, so if a previous operation fails the original

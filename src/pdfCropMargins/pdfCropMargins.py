=====================================================================

A command-line application to crop the margins of PDF files.  Cropping the
margins can make it easier to read the pages of a PDF document -- whether the
document is printed or displayed on a screen -- because the fonts appear
larger.  Margin-cropping is also useful at times when one PDF is included in
another as a graphic.  Many options are available.

def crop(argv_list=None, *, quiet=False, string_io=False):
    """Crop the PDF file using the arguments specified in `sys.argv`.  If a list is
    passed as `argv_list` then it is used instead of `sys.argv`.  This function
    can be called as a library routine for running the `pdfCropMargins` program.

    The function returns four values.  The first is the pathname of the cropped
    output document, or `None` if the cropping failed.  The second return value
    is either `None` or, in the event of a `SystemExit` exception, the exit
    code.  (A `SystemExit` is the usual way pdfCropMargins exits.)  The third
    and fourth arguments always have `None` values unless either the
    `string_io` or the `quiet` keyword option is set true (see below).

    The `string_io` and `quiet` keyword options, if either is selected,
    temporarily redefine `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to intercept the usual
    print commands from pdfCropMargins and save the text as strings.  If
    `string_io` is true then the final two return values are strings holding
    the stdout and stderr output, respectively.  If `quiet` is true then no
    echoing to stdout or stderr is performed while pdfCropMargins runs.  The
    `quiet` option implies the `string_io` option, so the string values are
    returned in both cases.

    The pdfCropMargins program normally raises `SystemExit` on correct
    operation or for error conditions which are detected and handled.  The
    `crop` function catches `SystemExit` and returns the error code.  The
    `stderr` string value may be needed to diagnose the cause of a nonzero exit
    code if `quiet` is set true.

    Unexpected exits, such as exceptions from dependencies or program bugs, can
    still occur.  Such exceptions are passed up to the caller.  Similarly,
    interrupts are not trapped or handled in the `crop` function."""
